## Rabin-Karp Algorithm
The Rabin-Karp algorithm is a string-searching algorithm that uses hashing to find patterns in strings. A string is an abstract data type that consists of a sequence of characters. Letters, words, sentences, and more can be represented as strings.

String matching is a very important application of computer science. If youâ€™ve ever searched through a document for a particular word, then you have benefitted from string-matching technology. String matching can also be used to detect plagiarism by comparing strings in document AA with strings in document BB.
